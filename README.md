# LMS-nosql

## Database free version of LibraryManagementSystem

- Writes data directly into the RFID card to reduce dependancies.
- Does not require a database to keep track of the data associated to the RFID card.
- Since the data is already written into the card itself, the requirement for databases is eliminated.

## Functionalities:

- Reads data, both the UID of the card and it's data.
- Writes data onto the RFID card.
- Keystroke function to type the RFID data anywhere.
